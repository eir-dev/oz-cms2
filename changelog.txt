# OZ CMS 2.0 Changelog

## 2024-12-19 18:30 - Content Dashboard Interface
- **MAJOR**: Created comprehensive dashboard interface on homepage
  - Replaces simple test editor with professional CMS dashboard
  - Displays all existing content items in responsive card grid
  - Shows file type icons, status badges, author, date, and tags
  - "Edit Content" buttons that open the approval detail modal
  - "Add New Content" button for creating new files
- **UI/UX**: Modern dashboard design with status indicators
  - Color-coded status badges (draft, in review, ready for approval, published, archived)
  - File type icons (Markdown, HTML, JSON, Image, Text)
  - Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop)
  - Loading states and empty state with call-to-action
- **INTEGRATION**: Seamless integration with existing approval modal
  - Edit existing content by clicking "Edit Content" button
  - Modal automatically loads selected content item
  - Dashboard refreshes after modal closes to show updates
- **REASON**: Users need a visual interface to manage content files
  - Previous test interface was too basic for production use
  - Dashboard provides overview of all content and their statuses
  - Essential for content management workflow

## 2024-12-19 18:00 - Static Content File Writing System
- **MAJOR**: Implemented actual static file writing for Cloudflare Pages
  - Content API now writes files to `public/` directory when content is created
  - Static files get committed to Git alongside metadata
  - Cloudflare Pages can now serve the actual content files
- **CREATED**: `public/content/` directory structure for static files
  - Files written with proper directory structure based on `targetLocation`
  - Automatic directory creation for nested paths
  - UTF-8 encoding for all content types
- **ENHANCED**: Git operations to include public files in commits
  - Updated `commitAndPush()` to add both `./data/*` and `./public/*`
  - Static content changes now trigger Git commits
  - Complete workflow: CMS → File Write → Git Commit → GitHub → Cloudflare Pages
- **REASON**: Previous system only saved metadata, not actual content files
  - Cloudflare Pages needs static files to serve
  - Enables true headless CMS functionality with static site generation

## 2024-12-19 17:45 - Fixed Git Authentication and Repository URL
- **FIX**: Resolved Git authentication issues and token exposure in logs
  - Made repository URL static: `https://github.com/eir-dev/oz-cms2.git`
  - Fixed token handling to prevent exposure in console logs
  - Simplified remote URL configuration logic
- **IMPROVED**: Main branch handling for new repositories
  - Better error detection for missing upstream branch
  - Automatic upstream setup with `--set-upstream origin main`
  - Handles both existing and new repository scenarios
- **SECURITY**: Removed token from log output to prevent credential exposure
- **REASON**: Complex URL manipulation was causing authentication failures
  - Token was being logged in plain text (security issue)
  - "refspec main does not match any" errors on new repositories

## 2024-12-19 17:30 - Auto-Configure Git Remote Repository
- **FIX**: Resolved "No remote repository configured" issue in Cloud Run deployment
  - Added `ensureRemoteRepository()` method to automatically configure GitHub remote
  - Auto-detects if remote is missing and sets up `origin` pointing to eir-dev/oz-cms2
  - Automatically handles HTTPS authentication with GitHub token
  - Fixes upstream branch configuration with `--set-upstream origin main`
- **IMPROVED**: Better error handling for Git push operations
  - Automatically sets upstream branch when needed
  - More descriptive logging for Git operations
  - Graceful fallback when push operations encounter issues
- **ARCHITECTURE**: Clarified deployment model in README
  - CMS runs on Google Cloud Run and pushes to GitHub
  - Static site auto-deploys from GitHub to Cloudflare Pages
  - Clean separation between dynamic CMS and static site hosting
- **REASON**: Docker containers start fresh without Git remote configuration
  - Container needs to programmatically set up the remote repository
  - Ensures Git operations work properly in deployed environment

## 2024-12-19 17:00 - GitHub Token Authentication Implementation
- **ADDED**: GitHub token authentication support for private repositories
  - Updated GitOps class to use GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
  - Automatic detection and configuration of GitHub repositories
  - Converts SSH URLs to HTTPS with token authentication
  - Enhanced error handling and logging for authentication setup
- **UPDATED**: Environment variable documentation in README.md
  - Added GITHUB_TOKEN to Cloudflare Pages deployment instructions
  - Updated .env.local example with GitHub token configuration
- **FEATURE**: Seamless authentication for private GitHub repositories
  - Supports both HTTPS and SSH GitHub URLs
  - Automatic remote URL reconfiguration with token
  - Graceful fallback when token is not provided
- **REASON**: User has GITHUB_TOKEN secret configured in Google Cloud
  - Need to use the same token in Cloudflare Pages environment
  - Enables authenticated Git operations for private repositories
  - Required for pushing commits from deployed application
